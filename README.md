## Model Training
The model training process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The `src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py` file contains the implementation of the prediction pipeline.

## Prediction Pipeline
The prediction pipeline is designed to take input data, preprocess it, and generate predictions using the trained model. It ensures that the entire process is efficient and scalable.

## User Interface
The web interface is built using Flask and provides a user-friendly experience. The main features include:
